LilyPad
=======

Multiple file/program launcher for UNIX-based systems. So far, we've only tested on Ubuntu. You should run it on Ubuntu to be sure.

**To run:**

Within the repository's folder, we've set up a Makefile that can run the necessary setup/startup commands. You'll need two terminal windows open to get it running.

- If this is your first time running Lilypad, run 'make deps'.
- Then, in one terminal window, run 'make back'.
- Then, in another terminal window, run 'make front'. The Lilypad interface should open (in Firefox) and display a welcome message.
- The help button lists all functionality of the program. Everything that you can see has been implimented fully.
- Note that we don't check to see if you have a listed program installed. You'll probably have to install programs like Chrome and Kile.
